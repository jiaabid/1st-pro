                <h2>GHALIB AND SIR SYED AHMED KHAN</h2>
                    <p>1855, Sir Syed Ahmed Khan finished his scholarly, well researched and illustrated edition of Abul Fazl's Ai’n-e Akbari.[citation needed] Having finished the work to his satisfaction, and believing that Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib was a person who would appreciate his labours, Syed Ahmad approached the great Ghalib to write a taqriz (in the convention of the times, a laudatory foreword) for it. Ghalib obliged, but what he produced was a short Persian poem castigating the Ai’n-e Akbari and, by implication, the imperial, sumptuous, literate and learned Mughal culture of which it was a product.[18] The least that could be said against it was that the book had little value even as an antique document. Ghalib practically reprimanded Syed Ahmad Khan for wasting his talents and time on dead things.[19] Worse, he highly praised the "sahibs of England" who at that time held all the keys to all the a’ins in this world</p>

                <p>Ghalib was buried in Hazrat Nizamuddin near the tomb of Nizamuddin Auliya. The side view of Mazar-e-Ghalib is shown in the image.</p>

                <h3>RELIGIOUS VIEWS</h3>
                <p>Ghalib placed a greater emphasis on seeking of God rather than ritualistic religious practices. Ghalib states:</p>

                For men who see, the Ka'aba is a compass, nothing more</blockquote>

                <h3>BHARAT VIEW</h3>
                    <p>In his poem "Chiragh-i-Dair" (The Lamp of Temple) which was composed during his trip to Benares during the spring of 1827, Ghalib mused about the land of Hindustan (the Indian subcontinent) and how Qiyamah (Doomsday) has failed to arrive, in spite of the numerous conflicts plaguing it</p>
                    <blockquote>Said I one night to a pristine seer
                    (Who knew the secrets of whirling Time)
                    'Sir you well perceive,
                    That goodness and faith,
                    Fidelity and love
                    Have all departed from this sorry land.
                    Father and son are at each other's throat;
                    Brother fights brother.
                    Unity and Federation are undermined.
                    Despite these ominous signs
                    Why has not Doomsday come?
                    Why does not the Last Trumpet sound?
                    Who holds the reins of the Final Catastrophe?</blockquote>
